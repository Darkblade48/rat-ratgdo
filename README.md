RAGE
AGAINST
THE
RATGDO

## Overview
This is an open source schematic for the ratgdo PCB as developed by Paul Wieland.  We feel there is cognitive dissonance between the refusal to provide schematics for the ratgdo PCB against the ratgdo project's use of open source code, open source licensing, and libraries used by other open source projects.

This project was created to allow people who need a ratgdo solution for their garage door opener but either cannot, or choose not to, source the solution from Paul Wieland. It also ensures that the PCB can be accessible as and when the project maintainer gives up on the project (much like Chamberlain themselves might do with their MyQ Cloud Service).

**If you want to buy a pre-made ratgdo setup, purchase it from Paul Wieland.**
